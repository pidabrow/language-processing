# language-processing

**Algorithm:**
The application constructs a tree-based model for consecutive words. Based on this structure, extracting all possible skip-grams is done using Depth First Serach algorithm.


**TODO:**

(1) limiting max skip-gram length

* naive solution - having the tree-based model in place along with all possible skip-grams it's easy to filter out the skip-grams that don't match max length

* optimal solution - while constructing the tree-based model, there should be information in each node what's the depth of given element starting with root depth = 0. 

(2) limiting max gap size

* naive solution - same approach as for max skip-gram length

* optimal solution - while creating nodes in the tree-based model, there should be an additional constraint that will check what would be the gap size if the node were created. 

Running locally
====================
The algorithm is designed to generate all possible skip-grams with every possible gap size combination.  
It needs some final tweaking (see two TODOs above, that will be implemented by Jan 10th 2021).  

### API:
* `GET /n-grams/demo`

* `PUT /n-grams` sample payload:
``` 
{
    "text" : "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog",
    "maxProductLength": 3
}
```

* `GET /skip-grams`

* `PUT /skip-grams/demo` sample payload:
``` 
{
    "text" : "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
}
```



Running locally, on `localhost:8080` and visiting `localhost:8080/skip-gram/demo` produces output like below.

**How to read this?**  
Assuming original phrase `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog` and sample result like following:  
`The quick brown fox jumps over the dog (gaps: 0,0,0,0,0,0,1)`, it means that there's a gap between last two word. In this case there's one word missing (`lazy`), which is between `lazy` and `dog` in the original sentence.   
`The` -> (0) -> `quick` -> (0) -> `brown` -> (0) -> `fox` -> (0) -> `jumps` -> (0) -> `over` -> (0) ->`the` -> (1) -> `dog`.

**Another example:**  
`The quick fox dog (gaps: 0,1,4)` -> `The` -> (0) -> `quick` -> (1) -> `fox` -> (4) -> `dog`  
There are two gaps in this skip-gram, one of size 1 (between `quick` and `fox`, there's `brown` missing), and the other of size 4 (between `fox` and `dog` there are missing `jumps`, `over`, `the` and `lazy`).
