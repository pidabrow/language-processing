# language-processing

**Algorithm:**
The application constructs a tree-based model for consecutive words. Based on this structure, extracting all possible skip-grams is done using Depth First Serach.


**TODO:**

(1) limiting max skip-gram length

* naive solution - having the tree-based model in place along with all possible skip-grams it's easy to filter out the skip-grams that don't match max length

* optimal solution - while constructing the tree-based model, there should be information in each node what's the depth of given element. 

(2) limiting max gap size

* naive solution - same as for max skip-gram length

* optimal solution - while creating nodes in the tree-based model, there should be an additional constraing that will check what would be the gap size if the node were created. 

Running locally
====================
Work in progress that needs some final tweaking. Running locally, on localhost:8080 and visiting localhost:8080/skip-gram/demo produces output like below. 

**How to read this btw?**
Assuming original phrase `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog` and sample result like following: `The quick brown fox jumps over the dog (gaps: 0,0,0,0,0,0,1)`, it means that there's a gap between last two word. In this case there's one word missing (`lazy`), which is between `lazy` and `dog` in the original sentence. 
`The` -> (0) -> `quick` -> (0) -> `brown` -> (0) -> `fox` -> (0) -> `jumps` -> (0) -> `over` -> (0) ->`the` -> (0) -> `dog`.

**Annother example:**
`The quick fox dog (gaps: 0,1,4)` -> `The` -> (0) -> `quick` -> (1) -> `fox` -> (4) -> `dog`
There are two gaps in this skip-gram, one of size 1 (between `quick` and `fox`, there's `brown` missing), and the other of size 4 (between `fox` and `dog` there are missing `jumps`, `over`, `the` and `lazy`).
